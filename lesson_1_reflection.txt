How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It led me directly to the lines where it could probably be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could greatly reduce debugging time and eficiency.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It helps to have a tidier and more organised history but you have the risk
    of loosing some unsaved changes. Also the commits will be logical changes 
    so they will be easier to track.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make you able to track changes that affect different files at the same
    time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can see and compare the diferent commits I've made on my project.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives you the ability to go back to a previous working version in a 
    fast, easy and clean fashion.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
